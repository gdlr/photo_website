                            <p> My first time on this board, I lucked into a head high, glassy day at Silver Strand, warbly peaks bouncing towards shore. I don't remember my first wave exactly, but I remember nursing a few turns and kicking out and just laughing like a giddy child—this board that I poured hours of labor into, this absurd experiment full of guesses and improvizations and mistakes that had to be fixed before it got in the water, it worked! Each wave I learned more about the shape, where to apply pressure, and I'd get a slightly better wave and sink a deeper turn than the last and kick out laughing even harder. I was in disbelief. It was one of the most rewarding surfing experiences of my life.

                            <p> I had the idea to build a surfboard again floating around in my head for a few years, but was put off by the mess, by the labor, by the fact that all that time and effort might end up in a dog of a surfcraft destined to collect dust. My childhood bedroom has 3 or 4 boards I shaped as a teenager, and they all suck, straight up, but they're too precious to ever get rid of. So they sit in the corner and collect dust.

                            <p> But when a cheap blank popped up on the local Craigslist, I knew I couldn't let this serpendipity go to waste.

                                The blank was already cut down in length for a 5'5" or so fish. I decided to make it asymmetric on a whim. I often found that with wide swallow tail twins the heel side of the tail interferes with the body's natural pivot for a heelside turn; removing that long swallow could potentially mitigate that drawback while still letting the toe side plane like a fish. Plus, what was there to lose?

                                Late at night on the floor of my bedroom, I sketched an outline based on two boards I liked, an Album twin fin on the toe side and a Lost Pocket Rocket on the heels. In the backyard, I cut the foam down by hand, the board resting on a folding table with a towel underneath. It was a slow process; it took me nearly two full days to finish the shape. Then, I converted my parking spot to a glassing bay, made it through the stress of laminating a whole board at once, and had something rideable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Somewhere between shaping and glassing, I was rock climbing when a friend pulled off a microwave size rock that narrowly missed me. It's the closest call I've had in any sport. I named the board Lucky Stone. There had to be some good juju in it.

                                For a year, I rode nothing but that board. Head high Rincon; punchy beach breaks; flat, mushy reefs; it was loose, it flew down the line, and it felt like a piece of my body. I brought it to Fiji, it was overpowered most days but had a few moments at small Cloudbreak, and that was it—this one was a keeper. I had low expectations and they were blown away. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                My expectations were much higher for the next few boards. They didn't quite live up to the mark. But this is the one that really started the journey, and knowing that I can make something that has a spark and a new feeling keeps me coming back.
